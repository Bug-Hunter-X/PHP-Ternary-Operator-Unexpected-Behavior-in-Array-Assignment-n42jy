This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to incorrect handling of the ternary operator within an array assignment:

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$newValue = isset($myArray['c']) ? $myArray['c'] + 1 : 0; 
$myArray['c'] = $newValue; //This line will not change the array because it's assigning 0 instead of 1
print_r($myArray);
?>
```
The issue lies in the fact that `$myArray['c']` is not set, so the ternary operator defaults to 0.  The subsequent assignment `$myArray['c'] = $newValue` only adds to the array if the index already exists, otherwise sets it to 0. The key 'c' is added to the array with a value of 0, not 1 as one might expect.
